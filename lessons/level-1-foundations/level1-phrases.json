You're probably pretty familiar with sentences, because they're something you have to keep in mind when writing in English and determining where to put the full stop to separate complex ideas into separate elements.\n\nSentences are made up of clauses, which most people spend less time being conscious of. They're the building blocks of sentences which need to contain two key ingredients:\n\n* **A subject**: This is what the clause is about. In the clause \"dinner was delicious\", *dinner* is the subject. In the clause \"the cat meowed\", *the* *cat* is the subject.\n\n* **The predicate**: This is what you're wanting to say about the subject. In the clause \"dinner was delicious\", the predicate is \"*was delicious*\". In the clause \"the cat meowed\", the predicate is \"*meowed*\". It's the information about the subject which the clause is designed to communicate. In English, the predicate must contain a verb, but in te reo Māori, that's not always the case.\n\n"

We'll return to using this terminology in the more advanced lessons, but for now we're just calling them *preceding words* and *following words* and introducing the technical words so you know what they are if you see them somewhere else.\n\nIn the same way the nucleus must contain a base word, the preceding and following words must be [[ref\\|particles\\|punga]] or {{punga}}. Some particles can only precede the nucleus, while others can only follow it.\n\nParticles are the glue which hold the sentences together, communicating additional context such as:\n\n* whether the sentence is past, present or future tense\n\n* whether an activity being described is ongoing or has ended\n\n* whether the sentence is about a specific object such as \"the cat\" or is less specific such as \"a cat\".\n\n* whether a possessive relationship is being described such as \"my car\", \"the student's work\" or \"your cat\"."

If we instead changed this phrase from {{e oma ana}} to {{i oma}}, the particle {{i}} would communicate that the running was something that happened in the past.\n\nThe second phrase in this sentence is {{te rāpeti}} which means \"the rabbit\". {{Rāpeti}} is the nucleus of the phrase and it is preceded by the word {{te}} which is called the *[[ref\\|definite article\\|putohu]]*, roughly translatable in this sentence to \"the\". There isn't a following word in this phrase, because the preceding and following parts of the phrase are optional. However, we could modify the phrase to be {{te rāpeti nei}} using the particle {{nei}} which signifies that we're talking about something near the speaker and changes the meaning to be \"this rabbit (near me)\" instead of \"the rabbit.\"\n\nYou can use the Sentence Analyser below to review the sentence, breaking it down into different elements for review. For this example, the Sentence Analyser will show you the full sentence or the individual phrases, but future uses of the Sentence Analyser might also break sentences down into clauses or words."

They include [[ref\\|pūmahi\\|pumahi]] (verbal particles) and commonly act as the predicate of a clause.\n\nNoun phrases are any phrase where the head word functions as a noun. They include [[ref\\|pūmau\\|pumau]] (determiners) as particles and commonly act as the subject of a clause.\n\nPrepositional phrases are phrases which are introduced by [[ref\\|pūhono\\|puhono]] (prepositions). They are used for a variety of purposes to add additional context to a clause."
