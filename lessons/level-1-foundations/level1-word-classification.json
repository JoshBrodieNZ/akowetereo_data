We'll dive into each word class in a lot more depth later.\n\nMost words in te reo Māori are either [[ref\\|tumu\\|tumu]] (bases) or [[ref\\|punga\\|punga]] (particles).\n\nBases are words like nouns, verbs or pronouns and communicate the central meaning of the sentence. They are also known as {{kupu kiko}} (content words). Meanwhile, particles are the glue which hold sentences together, communicating additional meaning. They are also known as {{kupu kōiwi}} (function words).\n\nFor example in the sentence {{Kei te kai au}} (I am eating), the verb [[word\\|kai\\|w-kai]] (eat) and the personal pronoun [[word\\|au\\|w-au]] (I) are the key pieces of information. The tense marker {{kei te}} provides additional grammatical structure but its job is to support {{kai}} and {{au}} and communicate the context linking these things."
