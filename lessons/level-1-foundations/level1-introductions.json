If you are speaking to more than one person, you use a different word instead of {{koe}}. This is because of the way that pronouns work in te reo Māori.\n\nIn English we use the word \"you\" as our second person pronoun. Unlike the first person pronoun where we change the word depending on whether we're talking about one person or multiple people (\"I\" or \"we\"), we use the word \"you\" for singular and plural cases (unless you use y'all). The second person pronoun in te reo Māori is more precise and a different form of the word is used depending on whether you're referring to one person, two people, or three or more people.\n\nSo we have [[word|koe|w-koe]] for one person, [[word|kōrua|w-koorua]] for two people, and [[word|koutou|w-koutou]] for three or more people. \n\nDepending on how many people you are speaking to you might use one of the following phrases (the highlighted word can be scrolled up or down to change the sentence):"
