Others break them out into complex subgroups. For ease of reference these are typically grouped into three classes based on an example word that belongs to each class, you have the {{mutu}} class, the {{ora}} class and the {{haere}} class.

Has it been completed or is it still ongoing? This includes the words: ka, kua, i, e … ana, kei te, i te. | Pūmahi | Name | Use | | :---- | :---- | :---- | | Kei te | Present Continious | Describes an action which is happening as we speak. | | Kāore… i te… | Present Continuous Negative | Negates a \"kei te\" sentence. | | I te | Past Continuous | Describes an action which was continuing in the past. | | Kāore… i te… | Past Continous Negative | Negates an \"i te\" sentence. Identical to negation for \"kei te\" and distinction must be inferred from context. | | E … ana | Continuous | Describes an action progressing and can be used to refer to the past, present or future. | | I | Past | Describes an action which is in the past and is now history. | | Kāore i | Past Negative | Negates an \"i\" sentence. | | Kua | Perfect | Describes an action which has taken place to arrive at the present (in the narrative) status of the object. | | Kāore ano… kia… | Perfect Negative | Negates a \"kua\" sentence. We add \"anō\" to mean that although the action hasn't happened, it is expected to. | | Ka | New Action Past New Action Present New Action Future | Ka is an inceptive marker, which means that it introduces a new action into a narrative in whatever context is already established. We are learning it as defaulting to future tense, although it is often referred to as defaulting to present tense. | | Kāore… e… | New Action Past Negative New Action Present Negative New Action Future Negative | Negates a \"ka\" sentence. |Pūmahi (verbal particles) are a crucial type of punga (particle) in te reo Māori that provide information about when and how an action takes place. They appear before verbs and indicate tense (when the action occurs), aspect (how the action unfolds over time), and mood (the speaker's attitude toward the action). Unlike English, where verbs change form to show tense (e.g., walk/walked/walking), te reo Māori keeps the verb form consistent and uses these particles to convey grammatical information. The main verbal particles include: 1. **Kei te** - Present continuous - Indicates an action happening right now - Example: \"Kei te kai au\" - \"I am eating\" 2. **I te** - Past continuous - Indicates an action that was happening in the past - Example: \"I te kai au\" - \"I was eating\" 3. **E ... ana** - Continuous (general) - Can refer to past, present, or future ongoing actions - Example: \"E kai ana au\" - \"I am/was eating\" 4. **I** - Simple past - Indicates a completed action in the past - Example: \"I kai au\" - \"I ate\" 5. **Kua** - Perfect aspect - Indicates a completed action with present relevance - Example: \"Kua kai au\" - \"I have eaten\" 6. **Ka** - Inceptive/narrative - Introduces a new action in a narrative; often indicates future actions - Example: \"Ka kai au\" - \"I will eat\" Each verbal particle also has a corresponding negative form, typically using \"kāore\" with a different particle combination: - \"Kei te\" → \"Kāore ... i te\" - \"I\" → \"Kāore ... i\" - \"Kua\" → \"Kāore anō ... kia\" - \"Ka\" → \"Kāore ... e\" Mastering verbal particles is essential for accurately expressing when actions occur and how they unfold over time in te reo Māori.",

In some grammars they are referred to as \"[deictic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deixis) particles\".\n\nThe three main positional particles in te reo Māori are:\n\n1. **Nei** - Here/This - Indicates a position close to the speaker - Example: \"tēnei whare\" - \"this house\" (near me) - Can also appear after a noun: \"te whare nei\" - \"this house\"\n2. **Nā** - There/That - Indicates a position close to the listener - Example: \"tēnā whare\" - \"that house\" (near you) - Can also appear after a noun: \"te whare nā\" - \"that house\"\n3. **Rā** - Over there/That - Indicates a position distant from both speaker and listener - Example: \"tērā whare\" - \"that house over there\" (away from both of us) - Can also appear after a noun: \"te whare rā\" - \"that house over there\"\n\nThese positional particles are often combined with the definite article \"te\" to form the demonstratives tēnei/ēnei (this/these), tēnā/ēnā (that/those near you), and tērā/ērā (that/those over there).\n\nThe pattern changes when referring to plural items:\n\n* \"tēnei\" (singular) becomes \"ēnei\" (plural)\n* \"tēnā\" (singular) becomes \"ēnā\" (plural)\n* \"tērā\" (singular) becomes \"ērā\" (plural)\n\nPositional particles provide crucial spatial orientation and help to clarify which specific item is being referred to based on its location relative to the speaker and listener."

This system is based on the nature of the relationship rather than the inherent properties of the objects themselves.\n\nWhen expressing possession in te reo Māori, we must choose between:\n\n* A-category possessives: ā, tā, mā, nā\n* O-category possessives: ō, tō, mō, nō\n\nThe key principle behind this choice is not simply ownership but relates to:\n\n* Control, dominance, and independence\n* Direction of responsibility, obligation, and support\n* Whether the possessor shelters, protects, guides, or leads the possessed\n\nIt's crucial to understand that the A/O distinction describes the relationship between things, not inherent properties of the objects themselves. The same object might belong to different categories depending on the relationship being described. ### Te karangatanga 'o' (O-category)\n\n**This category generally includes:**\n\n* The land, landmarks, mountains, rivers, and homes\n* Types of shelter and sources of life\n* One's whakapapa, ancestry, and lineage\n* Those who care for you (parents, teachers, leaders)\n* People in the same generation or above\n* All types of friends (using the word \"hoa\")\n* Clothing, accessories, and adornments\n* Body parts, including mind and figurative heart\n* Thoughts, memories, knowledge\n* Feelings and emotions\n* Inherent qualities ### Te karangatanga 'a' (A-category) **This category generally includes:**\n\n* Those with less authority or lower in hierarchy than you\n* Romantic partners (except when using \"hoa\")\n* Animals (except horses used as transport), birds, fish\n* Trees and plants\n* Food and drink (except fresh water and medicine)\n* Actions, activities, jobs, and work\n* Tools, equipment, and human-made items\n\nContext is key in determining the appropriate category. For example, a house might be in the O-category when describing it as shelter for yourself, but in the A-category when referring to it as something you built for someone else."

In that text, David Kārena-Holmes recognises only noun and verb phrases, however we will also be using some other classes of phrase imported from other grammars:\n\n* [[ref\\|Prepositional Phrases\\|kiianga-puuhono]] are any phrase which starts with a preposition.\n* [[ref\\|Connective Phrases\\|kiianga-hono]] are used to link two ideas together.\n* [[ref\\|Comparative Phrases\\|kiianga-whakatairite]] are used to describe the difference between two things."

These particles provide crucial information about the spatial or temporal relationship between the action, the speaker, and other referents in the discourse.\n\nThe main directional particles in te reo Māori are:\n\n1. **Mai** - Towards - Indicates movement or action directed towards the speaker or the subject\n2. **Atu** - Away - Indicates movement or action directed away from the speaker or the subject\n3. **Ake** - Upwards - Indicates movement or action in an upward direction from the subject. Can also indicate action in a future time\n4. **Iho** - Downwards - Indicates movement or action in a downward direction from the subject. Can also indicate action in a past time\n\nThese directional particles often follow verbs to specify the direction of the action, and they can combine with other particles to create more specific meanings. They play a significant role in spatial orientation within te reo Māori discourse.\n\nThe directional particles \"mai\" and \"atu\" are particularly common and important for distinguishing whether an action is moving towards or away from the speaker or another reference point."

There are a number of different ways to think about the differences between these words. Conceptually, base words describe things that are part of our experience: objects in the world, emotions, actions that can be taken. In contrast, particles are the \"little words\" that provide structure to sentences.\n\nGrammatically, base words are words which occupy the nucleus of a [[ref\\|Phrase\\|kiianga]] while particles are the words which occupy the peripheries.\n\nDifferent authors of grammar textbooks take different approaches to cataloguing the behaviours of words. This resource will not align perfectly with any specific text on the subject, but will pick and choose from a variety of sources. In particular, it will take the following positions:\n\n* Te reo Māori does not have a word class for [[ref\\|Adjectives\\|tuahua]]. It has sub-classes of nouns and verbs which can be used in a similar way to how adjectives are used in English but which are not a distinct adjective class.\n* There are a number of words with the same spelling and pronunciation. In many cases they have related meanings. One example is the word [[word\\|kai\\|w-kai]]. {{Kai}} can be used as a verb meaning \"to eat\" but it can also be used as a noun meaning \"food\". Additionally, there is a verbal particle {{kai}} which is a variant of {{kei}} used in some dialects. Some authors take the view that some verbs can be used as nouns (or vice-versa). Others take the view that words such as {{kai}} belong to a \"universals\" class of words with multiple functions. This resource will take the position that {{kai}} (noun), {{kai}} (verb) and {{kai}} (verbal particle) are all separate words, even though some of their meanings are related."
