    "longDefinition": "\nTūmahi (verbs) are a fundamental type of [[ref|tumu|tumu]] (base word) in te reo Māori that express actions, occurrences, or states of being. Also known as \"kupumahi,\" they form the core of verbal phrases and sentences.\n\nA key characteristic of te reo Māori verbs is that, unlike English verbs, they do not change form to indicate tense, person, or number. Instead, [[ref|pūmahi|pumahi]] (verbal particles) such as \"ka,\" \"kua,\" \"i,\" \"e...ana,\" and \"kei te\" are used before the verb to indicate when and how the action takes place.\n\nTe reo Māori verbs are classified into several important categories ([[ref|see Verb Classification for detailed information|verb-classification]]):\n\n1. **[[ref|Tūmahi Whiti (Transitive Verbs)|tumahi-whiti]]**\n    - Describe actions that directly affect another person or thing\n    - Take a direct object (often marked with \"i\")\n    - Can be used in passive voice with special suffixes\n    - Examples: tapahi (cut), whakapaipai (decorate), patu (hit)\n\n2. **[[ref|Tūmahi Poro (Intransitive Verbs)|tumahi-poro]]**\n    - Describe actions that don't require a direct object\n    - The action can be completed with only one participant\n    - Examples: moe (sleep), hīkoi (walk), takoto (lie down)\n\n3. **[[ref|Tūmahi Āhua (Stative Verbs)|tumahi-ahua]]**\n    - Describe emotions or attributes of people or things\n    - Examples: pōuri (sad), riri (angry), pūhaehae (jealous)\n\n4. **[[ref|Tūmahi Oti (Neuter Verbs)|tumahi-oti]]**\n    - Describe the completion of an action or a state of being\n    - Examples: mate (die/dead), pau (be consumed), pakaru (broken)\n\nUnderstanding the different classes of verbs is essential for forming grammatically \ncorrect sentences and for using appropriate verbal particles and constructions.\n  ",

    "longDefinition": "\n    ## About Classes of Verb \n\n    Te reo Māori verbs are categorized into several distinct classes based on their grammatical behavior. \n\n    There are a number of verbs which behave very similarly for many purposes, but with subtle \n    differences in how they work from a technical  perspective. Some linguists have considered \n    statives, neuter verbs and adjectives to all be one class of word. Others break them out into \n    complex subgroups.\n\n    For ease of reference, verbs are typically grouped into three classes based on example words \n    that belong to each class: the \"mutu\" class, the \"haere\" class and the \"ora\" class. These have \n    been labeled differently by linguists over time.\n\n    ### Historical Terminology Evolution\n\n    This table shows how different linguists and scholars have categorized these three verb classes \n    over time:\n\n    | | mutu | haere | ora |\n    |---|---|---|---|\n    | **Maunsell (1842)** *(considered this grouping tentative)* | neuter (the term at the time for what we now call intransitive) | neuter (the term at the time for what we now call intransitive) | neuter (the term at the time for what we now call intransitive) |\n    | **Williams (1862)** | participles (but observed they behave like neuter [intransitive] verbs) | intransitive (first establishing a distinction between neuter and intransitive) | adjectives (but observed they behave like neuter [intransitive] verbs) |\n    | **Biggs (1969)** | stative (this label introduced to describe verbs that don't take the passive ending) | universals | stative (this label introduced to describe verbs that don't take the passive ending) |\n    | **Hohepa (1969)** | stative verbs | not mentioned | stative adjectives |\n    | **Hooper (1982)** *[convention adopted by Bauer 1997]* | neuter verb | action intransitives | state intransitives |\n    | **Harlow (2001)** | neuter verbs (often called statives) | intransitive | adjectives |\n    | **Jacob (2015)** <br> *He Iti Kahurangi* | tūmahi oti (neuter verbs) [Jacob gives \"pakaru\", \"pau\" and \"mahue\" as examples which other texts pair with \"mutu\" class verbs] | tūmahi poro | split into tūmahi āhua (statives) [which is referred to as a type of tūmahi poro] and tūāhua (adjectives) based on whether they pair with a verbal particle or a noun |\n\n    ### Modern Classification\n\n    In contemporary te reo Māori teaching, and in these notes these verbs are classified as:\n\n    1. **[[ref|Tūmahi Oti (Neuter Verbs)|tumahi-oti]]** - The \"mutu\" class \n    2. **[[ref|Tūmahi Poro (Intransitive Verbs)|tumahi-poro]]** - The \"haere\" class\n    3. **[[ref|Tūmahi Āhua (Stative Verbs)|tumahi-ahua]]** - The \"ora\" class\n    \n    **[[ref|Tūāhua|tuahua]]** (Adjectives) are split out from Tūmahi Āhua based on whether the word pairs with a verbal particle or a noun.\n  ",

They appear before verbs and indicate tense (when the action occurs), aspect (how the action unfolds over time), and mood (the speaker's attitude toward the action).\n\n  \nUnlike English, where verbs change form to show tense (e.g., walk/walked/walking), te reo Māori keeps the verb form consistent and uses these particles to convey grammatical information.\n\n  \nThe main verbal particles include:   \n1. **Kei te** - Present continuous - Indicates an action happening right now - Example: \"Kei te kai au\" - \"I am eating\"   \n2. **I te** - Past continuous - Indicates an action that was happening in the past - Example: \"I te kai au\" - \"I was eating\"   \n3. **E ... ana** - Continuous (general) - Can refer to past, present, or future ongoing actions - Example: \"E kai ana au\" - \"I am/was eating\"   \n4. **I** - Simple past - Indicates a completed action in the past - Example: \"I kai au\" - \"I ate\"   \n5. **Kua** - Perfect aspect - Indicates a completed action with present relevance - Example: \"Kua kai au\" - \"I have eaten\"   \n6. **Ka** - Inceptive/narrative - Introduces a new action in a narrative; often indicates future actions - Example: \"Ka kai au\" - \"I will eat\"   \nEach verbal particle also has a corresponding negative form, typically using \"kāore\" with a different particle combination:   \n  - \"Kei te\" → \"Kāore ... i te\" - \"I\" → \"Kāore ... i\" - \"Kua\" → \"Kāore anō ... kia\" - \"Ka\" → \"Kāore ... e\"   \nMastering verbal particles is essential for accurately expressing when actions occur and how they unfold over time in te reo Māori.",

These verbs require a direct object—someone or something that receives the action of the verb.\n    \nTransitive verbs can be used in either active or passive forms depending on the type of sentence or \"voice\" they are being used in. When used in an active sentence they are called \"tūmahi hāoho\" (active verbs) and when used in a passive sentence they are called \"tūmahi hāngū\" (passive verbs). To make an tūmahi hāoho into a tūmahi hāngū you add a special kūmuri (suffix) or whiore (tail) to the word such as in adding the suffix \"-tia\" to \"whakapai\" to get the tūmahi hāngū whakapaitia. Each tūmahi hāoho can only take a limited subset of suffixes and a dictionary is required to know which are appropriate for each word. Some tūmahi hāoho have irregular passive forms where the word is transformed more than adding a simple suffix.\n\nMāori has a special construction for expressing transitive actions where the second participant (patient) is indefinite and non-specific (where the listener has no information about which particular individual is involved), for example:\n- Kei te ruku kōura rātou. - They are diving for crayfish. (Not a specific crayfish.)\n\nNon-specific patients form compound verbs, so the object 'kōura' is incorporated into the verb to form the compound verb \"ruku kōura\" or \"crayfish diving\".\n  ",

These particles serve to introduce nouns and provide crucial information about their role in the sentence, their specificity, and whether they are singular or plural. \n\n  \nNominal particles in te reo Māori fall into two main categories:   \n1. **[[ref|Pūmau|pumau]] (Determiners)** - These particles specify the identity or quantity of the noun - Include articles like \"te\" (the, singular), \"ngā\" (the, plural), \"he\" (a/some) - Include demonstratives like \"tēnei\" (this), \"tēnā\" (that), \"tērā\" (that over there) - Example: \"te whare\" (the house), \"ngā whare\" (the houses), \"he whare\" (a house/houses)   \n2. **[[ref|Pūhono|puhono]] (Prepositions)** - These particles show the relationship between the noun and other elements - Include prepositions like \"ki\" (to), \"i\" (from, by), \"mō\" (for), \"ko\" (topic marker) - Example: \"ki te whare\" (to the house), \"i te whare\" (from the house)   \n\nThe choice of nominal particle is crucial for constructing grammatically correct sentences in te reo Māori. For example: \n\n- \"te\" specifies a singular, definite noun: \"te whare\" (the house) \n\n- \"ngā\" specifies a plural, definite noun: \"ngā whare\" (the houses)\n\n- \"he\" indicates an indefinite noun (either singular or plural): \"he whare\" (a house/houses) \n\n- \"a\" is used before personal names and some pronouns: \"a Mere\" (Mary)   \n\nWithin the pūhono (prepositions) category, particles can indicate various relationships:\n\n- \"ki\" shows movement towards or recipient: \"ki a Mere\" (to Mary)\n\n- \"i\" indicates source, location, or agent: \"i te whare\" (from/at the house)\n\n- \"mō\" indicates purpose or beneficiary: \"mō te tamaiti\" (for the child)",

These particles often work in conjunction with the \n    versatile particle \"ai,\" which serves multiple grammatical functions.\n    \n    The main TAM particles include:\n    \n    1. **I** - Past Tense\n       - Indicates actions that occurred in the past and are now complete\n       - Example: \"I haere au\" - \"I went\"\n       - Used to establish past time reference at the beginning of a narrative\n    \n    2. **I te** - Past Continuous\n       - Indicates actions that were ongoing in the past\n       - Example: \"I te kai au\" - \"I was eating\"\n       - Focuses on the process rather than completion\n    \n    3. **Kei te** - Present Continuous\n       - Indicates actions happening at the present moment\n       - Example: \"Kei te mahi au\" - \"I am working\"\n       - Often ambiguous with the locative construction \"kei te + noun\"\n    \n    4. **E...ana** - General Continuous\n       - Indicates ongoing actions without specific time reference\n       - Example: \"E mahi ana au\" - \"I am/was working\"\n       - More general than \"kei te\" or \"i te\"\n    \n    5. **Kua** - Perfect Aspect\n       - Indicates completed actions with current relevance\n       - Example: \"Kua tae mai ia\" - \"He/she has arrived\"\n       - Emphasizes the resulting state rather than the action itself\n    \n    6. **Ka** - Inceptive/Narrative\n       - Introduces new actions in a sequence\n       - Often indicates future in isolation, but follows established time references\n       - Example: \"Ka haere au\" - \"I will go/I go\"\n       - Used for habitual actions or general truths\n    \n    7. **E** (+ future marker)\n       - Future tense\n       - Example: \"E haere au āpōpō\" - \"I will go tomorrow\"\n       - Often used in subordinate clauses\n    \n    The particle \"ai\" often works alongside TAM particles and serves several functions:\n    \n    1. **Anaphoric ai** - Refers back to a previously mentioned reason, time, or place\n       - Example: \"I haere au ki te tāone i te Rātapu. I hoko ai au i te kākahu.\" \n         (\"I went to town on Sunday. (That's when/where) I bought the clothes.\")\n    \n    2. **Habitual ai** - Indicates regularly occurring actions\n       - Example: \"Ka haere au ki te kura ia rā, ka ako ai i te reo Māori.\"\n         (\"I go to school every day, (and there) I learn te reo Māori.\")\n    \n    3. **Resultative ai** - Indicates an action that results from another\n       - Example: \"I whiti te rā, ka mahana ai te whenua.\"\n         (\"The sun shone, (as a result) the land became warm.\")\n    \n    4. **Locative ai** - Indicates the place where an action occurs\n       - Example: \"Ko te whare tēnei i noho ai mātou.\"\n         (\"This is the house (where) we lived.\")\n    \n    The interplay between TAM particles and \"ai\" creates a sophisticated system for expressing \n    temporal and logical relationships in te reo Māori, allowing speakers to precisely communicate \n    when and how actions occur and their relationships to other actions or states.\n  ",

        "content": "The A/O categories (karangatanga a/o) represent a fundamental concept in te reo Māori that determines which possessive particles and possessive pronouns to use when describing relationships between things. This system is based on the nature of the relationship rather than the inherent properties of the objects themselves.\n\nWhen expressing possession in te reo Māori, we must choose between:\n\n* A-category possessives: ā, tā, mā, nā\n* O-category possessives: ō, tō, mō, nō\n\nThe key principle behind this choice is not simply ownership but relates to:\n\n* Control, dominance, and independence\n* Direction of responsibility, obligation, and support\n* Whether the possessor shelters, protects, guides, or leads the possessed\n\nIt's crucial to understand that the A/O distinction describes the relationship between things, not inherent properties of the objects themselves. The same object might belong to different categories depending on the relationship being described.\n\n**Te karangatanga 'o' (O-category) generally includes:**\n\n* The land, landmarks, mountains, rivers, and homes\n* Types of shelter and sources of life\n* One's whakapapa, ancestry, and lineage\n* Those who care for you (parents, teachers, leaders)\n* People in the same generation or above\n* All types of friends (using the word \"hoa\")\n* Clothing, accessories, and adornments\n* Body parts, including mind and figurative heart\n* Thoughts, memories, knowledge\n* Feelings and emotions\n* Inherent qualities\n\n**Te karangatanga 'a' (A-category) generally includes:**\n\n* Those with less authority or lower in hierarchy than you\n* Romantic partners (except when using \"hoa\")\n* Animals (except horses used as transport), birds, fish\n* Trees and plants\n* Food and drink (except fresh water and medicine)\n* Actions, activities, jobs, and work\n* Tools, equipment, and human-made items\n\nContext is key in determining the appropriate category. For example, a house might be in the O-category when describing it as shelter for yourself, but in the A-category when referring to it as something you built for someone else."

It can be:\n    \n    - **Verbal Predicate**: A phrase beginning with a verbal particle\n      Example: \"Ka kai\" (will eat) in \"Ka kai au\" (I will eat)\n    \n    - **Nominal Predicate**: A phrase identifying or classifying the subject\n      Example: \"He kaiako\" (is a teacher) in \"He kaiako ia\" (He/she is a teacher)\n    \n    The predicate typically comes first in a te reo Māori sentence, unlike English where \n    the subject usually comes first.\n    \n    ### 2. **Kaiwhakamahi (Subject)**\n    \n    The subject tells us who or what the predicate refers to. It answers the question \n    \"who/what is performing the action or being described?\"\n    \n    Example: \"au\" (I) in \"Ka kai au\" (I will eat)\n    Example: \"ia\" (he/she) in \"He kaiako ia\" (He/she is a teacher)\n    \n    In some contexts, particularly with passive sentences or when clear from context, \n    the subject may be omitted.\n    \n    ### 3. **Kōrero Tāpiri (Comments)**\n    \n    Comments add additional information to the sentence and almost always begin with a preposition. \n    They are optional elements that provide context, clarification, or extra details.\n    \n    Comments can serve various functions:\n    \n    - **Direct Objects**: \"Kei te horoi ia i tana kurī\" (She is washing her dog)\n      The comment \"i tana kurī\" specifies what is being washed\n    \n    - **Locations**: \"I mate te kuia i te hōhipera\" (The elderly woman died in the hospital)\n      The comment \"i te hōhipera\" indicates where the event occurred\n    \n    - **Time**: \"I tīmata te hui i te waru karaka\" (The meeting started at eight o'clock)\n      The comment \"i te waru karaka\" specifies when the event happened\n    \n    - **Means/Route**: \"Ka haere mā te huarahi ki Pukeorapa\" (Will go via the road to Pukeorapa)\n      The comment \"mā te huarahi\" indicates the route taken\n    \n    - **Purpose**: \"He pukapuka mō te Pakanga Tuarua\" (A book about World War II)\n      The comment \"mō te Pakanga Tuarua\" specifies the subject matter\n    \n    - **Possession**: \"Te whare o te rangatira\" (The house of the chief)\n      The comment \"o te rangatira\" indicates ownership\n    \n    - **Reason/Cause**: \"Kua mākū katoa ō rātou kākahu i te ua\" (Their clothes are all wet from the rain)\n      The comment \"i te ua\" explains the cause\n    \n    - **Agents (in passive or neuter constructions)**: \"I pakaru te wini i a Tamahae\" (The window was broken by Tamahae)\n      The comment \"i a Tamahae\" identifies the agent\n    \n    Understanding how these three components work together is crucial for constructing \n    and analyzing sentences in te reo Māori.\n  ",

Unlike \n    English, passive constructions are very common in te reo Māori and are often preferred \n    in certain contexts.\n    \n    ## Characteristics of Passive Sentences\n    \n    1. **Patient as Subject**\n       - The person or thing receiving the action becomes the grammatical subject\n       - The subject typically follows the verb phrase\n       - Example: \"Ka kainga te āporo e Mere\" (The apple will be eaten by Mary)\n       - Here, \"te āporo\" (the apple) is the subject/patient\n    \n    2. **Passive Verb Form**\n       - The verb takes a passive suffix\n       - Common suffixes include -a, -ia, -hia, -kia, -mia, -ria, -tia, -na, -nga, -ina\n       - The specific suffix depends on the verb (must be learned for each verb)\n       - Example: \"kai\" (eat) becomes \"kainga\" (be eaten)\n    \n    3. **Agent Marking**\n       - The agent (doer) is marked with \"e\" if mentioned\n       - Example: \"Ka kainga te āporo e Mere\" (The apple will be eaten by Mary)\n       - Here, \"e Mere\" indicates Mary is the agent\n       - The agent may be omitted if unknown or unimportant\n    \n    4. **Basic Structure**\n       - Follows the pattern: [Verb+passive suffix] [Patient/Subject] [e Agent (optional)]\n    \n    ## When to Use Passive Voice\n    \n    Passive voice is frequently used in te reo Māori when:\n    \n    1. **Emphasizing the recipient**\n       - When the focus is on what happens to someone or something\n       - Example: \"Kua tuhia te reta\" (The letter has been written)\n    \n    2. **Agent is unknown or unimportant**\n       - When who performed the action is less relevant\n       - Example: \"I whakahoahoa te whare\" (The house was decorated)\n    \n    3. **Cultural emphasis on respect**\n       - When discussing actions of respected persons or groups\n       - Example: \"I kōrerotia ngā tikanga e ngā kaumātua\" \n         (The protocols were spoken about by the elders)\n    \n    4. **Narrative style**\n       - Passive is often preferred in traditional storytelling\n       - Example: \"Ka pātaia e Māui tōna whaea\" \n         (Māui's mother was asked by him)\n    \n    5. **Describing processes**\n       - When focusing on what happens rather than who does it\n       - Example: \"Ka tapahia te rākau, ka whakamahia hei waka\" \n         (The tree is cut down, [then] is used as a canoe)\n    \n    Understanding passive sentences is crucial in te reo Māori as they are a \n    fundamental part of the language's structure and style, used much more \n    frequently than in English.\n  ",

There are several types of \n    question sentences in te reo Māori, each with specific structures and functions.\n    \n    ## Types of Questions\n    \n    1. **Pātai Āe-Kāo (Yes/No Questions)**\n       - Also called pātai kati (closed questions)\n       - Can be answered with \"āe\" (yes) or \"kāore\" (no)\n       - Often formed by using the same structure as statements, but with rising intonation\n       - Example: \"Kei te hiakai koe?\" (Are you hungry?)\n       - Negated yes/no questions often use \"kāore\": \"Kāore koe e haere ana ki te kura?\" \n         (Aren't you going to school?)\n    \n    2. **Pātai Tūpātai (Information Questions)**\n       - Use interrogative words (tūpātai) such as:\n         - \"aha\" (what)\n         - \"wai\" (who)\n         - \"hea\" (where)\n         - \"āhea\" (when - future)\n         - \"nāhea\" (when - past)\n         - \"pēhea\" (how)\n         - \"hia\" (how many)\n         - \"tehea/ēhea\" (which)\n       - Example: \"Ko wai tō ingoa?\" (What is your name?)\n       - Example: \"Kei hea tō pōtae?\" (Where is your hat?)\n    \n    3. **Pātai Kōwhiri (Alternative/Choice Questions)**\n       - Present two or more alternatives, often using \"rānei\" (or)\n       - Example: \"Ka haere koe mā runga pahi, mā runga waka rānei?\" \n         (Will you go by bus or by car?)\n    \n    ## Question Formation Techniques\n    \n    1. **Intonation**\n       - Regular statements can become questions by using rising intonation\n       - Example: \"Kei te pai koe?\" (Are you well?)\n    \n    2. **Question Particles/Words**\n       - Use of specific interrogative words/particles\n       - Many form set patterns with prepositions:\n         - \"i hea\" (where - past location)\n         - \"kei hea\" (where - present location)\n         - \"ki hea\" (where to)\n         - \"nō hea\" (where from - origin)\n    \n    3. **Structural Changes**\n       - Some question types involve changes to normal sentence structure\n       - \"Ko\" is often used in identification questions: \"Ko wai tēnā?\" (Who is that?)\n    \n    4. **Negation in Questions**\n       - \"Kāore\" combined with appropriate verbal particles\n       - Example: \"Kāore anō koe kia kite i te kaiako?\" \n         (Haven't you seen the teacher yet?)\n    \n    Interrogative sentences are essential for interactive communication, allowing \n    speakers to gather information, seek clarification, make requests, or confirm \n    understanding in te reo Māori.\n  ",

    "longDefinition": "\n    Rerewhakahau (command sentences) are sentences in te reo Māori that give directions, \n    instructions, or orders to the listener. They are used to tell someone to do something \n    and can range from strong commands to polite requests.\n    \n    ## Forms of Commands\n    \n    Te reo Māori has several ways to form commands, depending on the type of verb and \n    the level of formality or directness required:\n    \n    1. **Direct Imperatives with Base Verb**\n       - For short, common verbs, use the base form without particles\n       - Example: \"Haere!\" (Go!)\n       - Example: \"Tū!\" (Stand!)\n    \n    2. **E + Verb**\n       - For some short verbs, use \"e\" before the verb\n       - Example: \"E tū!\" (Stand!)\n       - Example: \"E noho!\" (Sit!)\n    \n    3. **Passive Commands (Tūhau hāngū)**\n       - For transitive verbs, use the passive form\n       - Often preferred for actions affecting objects\n       - Example: \"Whakamāramatia te tikanga!\" (Explain the meaning!)\n       - Example: \"Tangohia ō hū!\" (Take off your shoes!)\n    \n    4. **Me + Verb**\n       - Softer, less direct commands or suggestions\n       - Expresses \"should\" or \"ought to\"\n       - Example: \"Me haere tātou ināianei\" (We should go now)\n       - Example: \"Me āta whakarongo koe\" (You should listen carefully)\n    \n    5. **Kia + Verb**\n       - Expresses wishes or gentle commands\n       - Example: \"Kia tere tō haere!\" (Be quick with your going!)\n       - Example: \"Kia mataara!\" (Be alert!)\n    \n    6. **Verb + ki/i phrase**\n       - Commands with specific directions\n       - Example: \"Haere ki te kura!\" (Go to school!)\n       - Example: \"Titiro ki tērā!\" (Look at that!)\n    \n    ## Command Intensity and Politeness\n    \n    The intensity of commands can be modified in several ways:\n    \n    1. **Intensifiers**\n       - Add words like \"tino\" (very) or \"kia\" to emphasize\n       - Example: \"Kia tino tere!\" (Be very quick!)\n    \n    2. **Softeners**\n       - Add words like \"koa\" (please) to make requests more polite\n       - Example: \"Āwhina mai koa\" (Please help me)\n    \n    3. **Inclusive Commands**\n       - Use \"tātou\" (we, including the listener) to make commands more inclusive\n       - Example: \"Me haere tātou\" (Let's go)\n    \n    Understanding the different forms of commands in te reo Māori is important for \n    giving appropriate instructions in different contexts, from formal to informal, \n    and for varying degrees of urgency or politeness.\n  ",

These particles provide crucial information about the spatial or temporal relationship between the action, the speaker, and other referents in the discourse.\n\nThe main directional particles in te reo Māori are:\n\n1. **Mai** - Towards - Indicates movement or action directed towards the speaker or the subject\n2. **Atu** - Away - Indicates movement or action directed away from the speaker or the subject\n3. **Ake** - Upwards - Indicates movement or action in an upward direction from the subject. Can also indicate action in a future time\n4. **Iho** - Downwards - Indicates movement or action in a downward direction from the subject. Can also indicate action in a past time\n\nThese directional particles often follow verbs to specify the direction of the action, and they can combine with other particles to create more specific meanings. They play a significant role in spatial orientation within te reo Māori discourse.\n\nThe directional particles \"mai\" and \"atu\" are particularly common and important for distinguishing whether an action is moving towards or away from the speaker or another reference point."
