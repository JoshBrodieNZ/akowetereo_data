[[ref|Pūwahi|puwahi]] (locative particles) - Words like \"i,\" \"hei,\" and \"kei\" used with locations 3. [[ref|Pūanga|adverbial-directional]] (directional particles) - Words like \"mai,\" \"atu,\" \"ake,\" and \"iho\" that show direction 4. [[ref|Pūhea|puhea]] (positional particles) - Words like \"nei,\" \"nā,\" and \"rā\" that show proximity 5. [[ref|Pūingoa|puingoa]] (nominal particles) - Words like \"te,\" \"ngā,\" \"he,\" \"a,\" and \"o\" that introduce nouns 6.

    "longDefinition": "Tūwāhi (locative nouns) are a special class of nouns in te reo Māori that specify location or position in space. They describe where something is in relation to a reference point, such as above, below, inside, or outside. Unlike regular nouns, locative nouns typically appear in [[ref|prepositional phrases|kianga-puhono]] and are usually preceded by [[ref|particles|punga]] such as \"i,\" \"ki,\" or \"kei\" to form expressions of location. Common locative nouns include:\n - runga - on top, above, south\n - raro - under, underneath, below, north\n - roto - in, inside\n - waho - out, outside\n - mua - in front, at the front, before\n - muri - behind, at the back\n - waenganui - in the middle, between, among\n - te taha mauī - on the left side\n - te taha matau - on the right side\n - tua - beyond, the other side (of a solid object)\n - tāwāhi - beyond, the other side (of an open space) There are also locatives that describe position in relation to the speaker/writer: - uta - ashore (while at sea), inland (while on the coast)\n - tai - at sea (while on shore), on the coast (while inland)\n - tawhiti - in the distance\n - konei - here (where I am, in this place)\n - konā - there (where you are, in that place)\n - korā, kō - there (away from us, in that other place)\n - reira - there (in that place we've been talking about) Locative nouns are essential for describing position, giving directions, and situating objects or events in space.

    "longDefinition": " ## About Classes of Verb Te reo Māori verbs are categorized into several distinct classes based on their grammatical behavior. There are a number of verbs which behave very similarly for many purposes, but with subtle differences in how they work from a technical  perspective. Some linguists have considered statives, neuter verbs and adjectives to all be one class of word. Others break them out into complex subgroups. For ease of reference, verbs are typically grouped into three classes based on example words that belong to each class: the \"mutu\" class, the \"haere\" class and the \"ora\" class. These have been labeled differently by linguists over time. ### Historical Terminology Evolution This table shows how different linguists and scholars have categorized these three verb classes over time: | | mutu | haere | ora | |---|---|---|---| | **Maunsell (1842)** *(considered this grouping tentative)* | neuter (the term at the time for what we now call intransitive) | neuter (the term at the time for what we now call intransitive) | neuter (the term at the time for what we now call intransitive) | | **Williams (1862)** | participles (but observed they behave like neuter [intransitive] verbs) | intransitive (first establishing a distinction between neuter and intransitive) | adjectives (but observed they behave like neuter [intransitive] verbs) | | **Biggs (1969)** | stative (this label introduced to describe verbs that don't take the passive ending) | universals | stative (this label introduced to describe verbs that don't take the passive ending) | | **Hohepa (1969)** | stative verbs | not mentioned | stative adjectives | | **Hooper (1982)** *[convention adopted by Bauer 1997]* | neuter verb | action intransitives | state intransitives | | **Harlow (2001)** | neuter verbs (often called statives) | intransitive | adjectives | | **Jacob (2015)** <br> *He Iti Kahurangi* | tūmahi oti (neuter verbs) [Jacob gives \"pakaru\", \"pau\" and \"mahue\" as examples which other texts pair with \"mutu\" class verbs] | tūmahi poro | split into tūmahi āhua (statives) [which is referred to as a type of tūmahi poro] and tūāhua (adjectives) based on whether they pair with a verbal particle or a noun | ### Modern Classification In contemporary te reo Māori teaching, and in these notes these verbs are classified as: 1. **[[ref|Tūmahi Oti (Neuter Verbs)|tumahi-oti]]** - The \"mutu\" class 2. **[[ref|Tūmahi Poro (Intransitive Verbs)|tumahi-poro]]** - The \"haere\" class 3. **[[ref|Tūmahi Āhua (Stative Verbs)|tumahi-ahua]]** - The \"ora\" class **[[ref|Tūāhua|tuahua]]** (Adjectives) are split out from Tūmahi Āhua based on whether the word pairs with a verbal particle or a noun.

    "longDefinition": "Pūmahi (verbal particles) are a crucial type of punga (particle) in te reo Māori that provide information about when and how an action takes place. They appear before verbs and indicate tense (when the action occurs), aspect (how the action unfolds over time), and mood (the speaker's attitude toward the action). Unlike English, where verbs change form to show tense (e.g., walk/walked/walking), te reo Māori keeps the verb form consistent and uses these particles to convey grammatical information. The main verbal particles include: 1. **Kei te** - Present continuous - Indicates an action happening right now - Example: \"Kei te kai au\" - \"I am eating\" 2. **I te** - Past continuous - Indicates an action that was happening in the past - Example: \"I te kai au\" - \"I was eating\" 3. **E ... ana** - Continuous (general) - Can refer to past, present, or future ongoing actions - Example: \"E kai ana au\" - \"I am/was eating\" 4. **I** - Simple past - Indicates a completed action in the past - Example: \"I kai au\" - \"I ate\" 5. **Kua** - Perfect aspect - Indicates a completed action with present relevance - Example: \"Kua kai au\" - \"I have eaten\" 6. **Ka** - Inceptive/narrative - Introduces a new action in a narrative; often indicates future actions - Example: \"Ka kai au\" - \"I will eat\" Each verbal particle also has a corresponding negative form, typically using \"kāore\" with a different particle combination: - \"Kei te\" → \"Kāore ... i te\" - \"I\" → \"Kāore ... i\" - \"Kua\" → \"Kāore anō ... kia\" - \"Ka\" → \"Kāore ... e\" Mastering verbal particles is essential for accurately expressing when actions occur and how they unfold over time in te reo Māori.",

    "longDefinition": "\nTūmahi whiti (transitive verbs) are a major class of verbs in te reo Māori that describe actions which affect or are directed toward another person or thing. These verbs require a direct object—someone or something that receives the action of the verb. Transitive verbs can be used in either active or passive forms depending on the type of sentence or \"voice\" they are being used in. When used in an active sentence they are called \"tūmahi hāoho\" (active verbs) and when used in a passive sentence they are called \"tūmahi hāngū\" (passive verbs). To make an tūmahi hāoho into a tūmahi hāngū you add a special kūmuri (suffix) or whiore (tail) to the word such as in adding the suffix \"-tia\" to \"whakapai\" to get the tūmahi hāngū whakapaitia. Each tūmahi hāoho can only take a limited subset of suffixes and a dictionary is required to know which are appropriate for each word. Some tūmahi hāoho have irregular passive forms where the word is transformed more than adding a simple suffix.\n\nMāori has a special construction for expressing transitive actions where the second participant (patient) is indefinite and non-specific (where the listener has no information about which particular individual is involved), for example:\n* Kei te ruku kōura rātou. - They are diving for crayfish. (Not a specific crayfish.)\n\nNon-specific patients form compound verbs, so the object 'kōura' is incorporated into the verb to form the compound verb \"ruku kōura\" or \"crayfish diving\". ",

Nominal particles in te reo Māori fall into two main categories: 1. **[[ref|Pūmau|pumau]] (Determiners)** - These particles specify the identity or quantity of the noun - Include articles like \"te\" (the, singular), \"ngā\" (the, plural), \"he\" (a/some) - Include demonstratives like \"tēnei\" (this), \"tēnā\" (that), \"tērā\" (that over there) - Example: \"te whare\" (the house), \"ngā whare\" (the houses), \"he whare\" (a house/houses) 2. **[[ref|Pūhono|puhono]] (Prepositions)** - These particles show the relationship between the noun and other elements - Include prepositions like \"ki\" (to), \"i\" (from, by), \"mō\" (for), \"ko\" (topic marker) - Example: \"ki te whare\" (to the house), \"i te whare\" (from the house) The choice of nominal particle is crucial for constructing grammatically correct sentences in te reo Māori. For example: - \"te\" specifies a singular, definite noun: \"te whare\" (the house) - \"ngā\" specifies a plural, definite noun: \"ngā whare\" (the houses)\n\n* \"he\" indicates an indefinite noun (either singular or plural): \"he whare\" (a house/houses) - \"a\" is used before personal names and some pronouns: \"a Mere\" (Mary) Within the pūhono (prepositions) category, particles can indicate various relationships:\n\n* \"ki\" shows movement towards or recipient: \"ki a Mere\" (to Mary)\n\n* \"i\" indicates source, location, or agent: \"i te whare\" (from/at the house)\n\n* \"mō\" indicates purpose or beneficiary: \"mō te tamaiti\" (for the child)",

        "content": "The A/O categories (karangatanga a/o) represent a fundamental concept in te reo Māori that determines which possessive particles and possessive pronouns to use when describing relationships between things. This system is based on the nature of the relationship rather than the inherent properties of the objects themselves.\n\nWhen expressing possession in te reo Māori, we must choose between:\n\n* A-category possessives: ā, tā, mā, nā\n* O-category possessives: ō, tō, mō, nō\n\nThe key principle behind this choice is not simply ownership but relates to:\n\n* Control, dominance, and independence\n* Direction of responsibility, obligation, and support\n* Whether the possessor shelters, protects, guides, or leads the possessed\n\nIt's crucial to understand that the A/O distinction describes the relationship between things, not inherent properties of the objects themselves. The same object might belong to different categories depending on the relationship being described.\n\n**Te karangatanga 'o' (O-category) generally includes:**\n\n* The land, landmarks, mountains, rivers, and homes\n* Types of shelter and sources of life\n* One's whakapapa, ancestry, and lineage\n* Those who care for you (parents, teachers, leaders)\n* People in the same generation or above\n* All types of friends (using the word \"hoa\")\n* Clothing, accessories, and adornments\n* Body parts, including mind and figurative heart\n* Thoughts, memories, knowledge\n* Feelings and emotions\n* Inherent qualities\n\n**Te karangatanga 'a' (A-category) generally includes:**\n\n* Those with less authority or lower in hierarchy than you\n* Romantic partners (except when using \"hoa\")\n* Animals (except horses used as transport), birds, fish\n* Trees and plants\n* Food and drink (except fresh water and medicine)\n* Actions, activities, jobs, and work\n* Tools, equipment, and human-made items\n\nContext is key in determining the appropriate category. For example, a house might be in the O-category when describing it as shelter for yourself, but in the A-category when referring to it as something you built for someone else."

These particles provide crucial information about the spatial or temporal relationship between the action, the speaker, and other referents in the discourse.\n\nThe main directional particles in te reo Māori are:\n\n1. **Mai** - Towards - Indicates movement or action directed towards the speaker or the subject\n2. **Atu** - Away - Indicates movement or action directed away from the speaker or the subject\n3. **Ake** - Upwards - Indicates movement or action in an upward direction from the subject. Can also indicate action in a future time\n4. **Iho** - Downwards - Indicates movement or action in a downward direction from the subject. Can also indicate action in a past time\n\nThese directional particles often follow verbs to specify the direction of the action, and they can combine with other particles to create more specific meanings. They play a significant role in spatial orientation within te reo Māori discourse.\n\nThe directional particles \"mai\" and \"atu\" are particularly common and important for distinguishing whether an action is moving towards or away from the speaker or another reference point."
