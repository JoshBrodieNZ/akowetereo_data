# Akowetereo Data Repository

This repository contains the learning content and data structure for the [Akowetereo](https://github.com/JoshBrodieNZ/akowetereo) application.

The goal of separating this data into its own repository is to **facilitate collaboration**. We encourage educators, speakers, and learners to contribute improvements, corrections, and new content to help grow this resource for everyone.

## Structure

*   **`streams.json`**: Defines the ordered streams (courses) of lessons.
*   **`lessons/`**: Lesson content organized by stream/course ID.
*   **`glossary.json`**: Definitions for te reo Māori grammar terms.
*   **`vocabulary-words.json`**: Dictionary of vocabulary words.
*   **`vocabulary-lists.json`**: Pre-defined lists of vocabulary for practice.
*   **`resources.json`**: External learning resources.
